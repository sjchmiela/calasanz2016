    p The <strong>Days in Diocese</strong> during World Youth Days 2016 is a time, when young people from all over the world are hosted in all Polish dioceses. This stage <strong>begins on 20<sup>th</sup> July and ends on 25<sup>th</sup> July</strong> 2016. We would like to invite calasantian youth to spend Days in Diocese in <a href="http://www.bolszewo.pijarzy.pl">Piarist Parish in Bolszewo</a> (Archdiocese of Gdańsk).
    p <strong>Bolszewo</strong> is a town located in north Poland, beautiful region of Kashubia. It's very conveniently located: not far away is the Baltic Sea and one of the most marvelous cities in the world – Gdańsk. Bolszewo is also very close to Wejherowo and Gdynia, appealing cities connected with tradition and Christianity.

    p Thanks to Gdańsk's own airport (GDN) it's <strong>easy to get to</strong> from nearly every place in the world.
    p The main place of our meeting in Bolszewo will be <strong>the Parish of The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary</strong>, where Piarists work. The youth will be hosted by families living in the parish.
