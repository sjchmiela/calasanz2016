  p We would like to experience the World Youth Days as a <strong>Calasanz group</strong>, gathering all the youth related to St. Joseph Calasanz, Piarist ministries and the Calasantian Family Community. We want to continue the tradition of calasantian youth's meetings, which had been held during previous World Youth Days in Madrit and Rio de Janeiro.
