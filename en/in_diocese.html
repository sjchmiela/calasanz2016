Beautifully situated Wejherowian Calvary, antique Market Square or unique palace and park is just a tip of the iceberg of what makes the city attractive. Not without a reason Wejherowo is called spiritual capital of Kashubia. One could not only find here richness of wonderful sacral buildings, but also find a moment to contemplate the last journey of Christ on calvarian hills or kneel and pray in front of the miraculous image of the Mother of God of Wejherowo. </p><p>Less than 30 kilometres from Bolszewo are borders of Tricity: Gdynia, Sopot and Gdańsk. These cities, located near the Bay of Gdańsk, on the southern shore of Baltic Sea have rich history and interesting architecture.</p><figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTvmgI-PbGs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Timelapse of Tricity</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Gdańsk is a provincial city, one of the biggest in Poland.</strong> It is deemed as a symbolic place of the outbreak of World War II and the beginning of collapse of communism in Central Europe. There are many architectural relics in Gdańsk, for example the biggest church of brick – Marian Basilica. Over 1000 year old Gdańsk, annually visited by thousands of tourists combines traditions of cultures of many nations. It is a paradise for old architecture lovers. One could wander around this city’s pretty town houses and medieval antiques for eternity.</p><figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtl9c2fPs9Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Promotional film about Gdańsk</figcaption></figure></section></div><div id="tile_5" class="tile--content"><h2><span>Days in Diocese concept</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><p class="strong">WYD meeting formula has obviously developed in the succeeding years.

It is a priceless time, when participants of the meeting can get to know each other and make valuable contacts and relationships. This week is filled with plenty of great tours, fun and engagement in the social projects prepared by the organizers. Plan according to which the meeting takes place as well as its nature is different in each of the dioceses and depends on their specific features. During WYD in 2016 “Days in the Dioceses” will last from 20 to 25 July.</p><p>Polish WYD Organisation Committee proposed that each polish diocese should take a biblical name, related to some specific place or event.</p><p>Taking up such a concept not only will allow us to prepare single, consistent program scheme, but will also simplify the youth from all around the world signing up in Polish dioceses – they can choose desired diocese according to exact biblical staging they will attend, not only according to geographical location.</p><p>Diocese in which we will host calasantian youth will take name of <strong>Capernaum</strong>.</p><p> </p><figure style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%"><img src="/img/names_of_dioceses@2x.jpg" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0" data-no-retina="true"><figcaption>Biblical names for Dioceses</figcaption></figure></section></div></div></article><footer class="footer--main"><p>Piarists in Poland, <a href="mailto:wyd@calasanz2016.com">wyd@calasanz2016.com</a></p></footer><script src='/js/build.499aeacc72a2a66cd70402d398b372fa.js'></script></body></html>
