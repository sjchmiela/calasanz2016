Together.</h3><p>After passing away of John Paul II the continuator of this beautiful dialogue between the Youth and the Church became Pope Benedict XVI, which presided meetings in Cologne (2005), Sydney (2008) and Madrid (2011). Thanks to His service Christ was constantly proclaimed and worshiped by young people of all the continents, and the Church could notice it’s young and happy face, so needed by modern world.</p><p>In July 2013 (Rio de Janeiro) with young people  met Pope Francis. He also announced that the next Youth Meeting will in 2016 is going to be in Kraków, Poland.</p><h3>WYD establishment</h3><p>As a date of establishing World Youth Days one could think 20th December, 1985, when John Paul II on Christmas Meeting expressed desire for World Youth Days to be every year on Palm Sunday as a diocesan meeting and every 2–3 years in a place chosen by Him as international meeting.</p><h3>Community, formation and joy of faith</h3><p>The purpose for the Days is experience of the huge Community of the Catholic Church, listening to God’s Words, celebrating Confession and Eucharist and joyful proclaiming of Jesus Christ as the Lord and Saviour.</p><p class="italic align-right"><a href="http://sdm.org.pl/index2.php?k=500">Source – sdm.org.pl</a></p></section></div><div id="tile_2" class="tile--content"><h2><span>WYD program</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><p>After the Days in Diocese stage, all the people are invited to go to the diocese which the Holy Father chose as a place to organise Central Celebrations (during WYD 2016 it’s Kraków).

Logo has been depicted inside the red outline of Poland (red is one of the national colours). Poland is homeland of St. John Paul II, zealous worshiper and apostle of God’s Mercy, originator of WYD. This is also the place of birth for St. Faustina Kowalska, through which Our Lord Jesus Christ reminded the world about his Mercy.</p><p><strong>Kraków</strong> – in the outline of Poland, in form of yellow circle has been place Kraków. This is the city of Basilica of Divine Mercy, to which since early years of childhood pilgrimed Karol Wojtyla – firstly laborer, then priest, bishop and cardinal. From there he set out in 1978 on a journey to Rome for the conclave. As John Paul II he came back here during all of his pilgrimages to Homeland. During the last of pilgrimages, in 2002 year he called this place a worldwide center of God’s Mercy worship and he entrusted the world to God’s merciful love.</p><h3>Main characters</h3><p><strong>Christ</strong> – the substance of every World Youth Day is meeting with Christ. He is symbolised by the Cross, which is one of the main elements of the logo.</p><p><strong>Youth</strong> – several times during earlier editions of WYD the symbol of youth became colorful circle. Likewise is in Kraków 2016 Logo. The yellow circle under cross is not only place of Kraków in Poland, but also symbolises youth from all around the world, which will gather here along with Pope Francis at the feet of the Cross.</p><h3>Meeting’s topic</h3><p><strong>Mercy</strong> – main topic of XXXI WYD is God’s Mercy. It’s symbol is a spark, about which mentions St. Faustina in her Diary:<blockquote>“As I was praying for Poland, I heard the words: «I bear a special love for Poland, […] From her will come forth the spark that will prepare the world for My final coming.»” [Diary 1732]</blockquote></p><p>The spark’s beams visible in logo refer to well known image of Jesus the Merciful. From the heart of Jesus on this images emerge two flames: blue, imaging water and red, symbolizing blood. Similarly in the logo they typify grace, which spreads and embraces young people around the world.</p><h3>Colors of the logo</h3><p>Colors of the WYD 2016 logo – <span class="wyd-red">red</span>, <span class="wyd-blue">blue</span> and <span class="wyd-yellow">yellow</span> – refer to the official colors of the city Kraków and it’s emblem.</p><p class="italic align-right"><a href="http://www.krakow2016.com/ftp/OPIS_SZCZEGOLOWY_LOGO_SDM_KRAKOW_2016.pdf">Source – krakow2016.com</a></p></section></div><div id="tile_4" class="tile--content"><h2><span>Discover Kraków</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><figure><div style="width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_kjuG1sqO1w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0"></iframe></div><figcaption>Video promoting WYD 20162016</figcaption></figure><figure><div style="width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ph5PE7BO6qs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0"></iframe></div><figcaption>Video promoting Kraków</figcaption></figure><p class="strong">Kraków is a city with a thousand-year tradition, the former seat of Polish kings and the capital of the country – today – an important European metropolis. Kraków's Old Town is a unique treasure trove of works of art, historical monuments and historic buildings representing nearly all architectural styles from the Middle Ages to the present day.</p><p>For at least hundreds of years the heart of the city remains Rynek Główny (Main Market Square) – the largest market square of medieval Europe, preserved unchanged since 1257, recorded on UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 1978. Every hour for 600 years from the tower of Marian Basilica rings out bugle call in all four directions of the world. The building standing in the middle of Market Square is a place called Sukiennice – medieval mart – is one of the most recognised polish antiques.</p><p>Kraków is also proud of the second oldest in Central Europe college – Jagiellonian University (among it’s students one could find Mikolaj Kopernik, famous astronomer and Pope John Paul II) and King’s Castle on Wawel, which dates back to the half of XIth century. Currently the Castle functions as a museum, making over 70 halls available to curious tourists, looking for eg. unique treasures of Reneissance. The Castle is easily recognised by it’s breathtaking arcade yard – pearl of Reneissance architecture.</p><p>Apart from monuments of the Old Town one can be intrigued by the Kazimierz district – place of centuries-old coexistence of two cultures – christian and jewish. Area filled with jewish antiques of worldly significance, but primarily a vibrant area, where take place bric-à-brac and pieces-of-art fairs, and where in cosy taverns and restaurants sounds live music. Worth noticing is also Nowa Huta district – the most interesing and most complete realisation of the dreams of architects of socialist realism.</p><p>Kraków is also a vibrant cultured city, in 2000 chosen on European Culture Capital. Every year in this city takes place around 100 different festivals and other cultural events of global repute. It’s also a city of modern museums, where visitor can stand eyeball to eyeball with history.</p><p>Doubtlessly Kraków captivates with unique atmosphere – sometimes supine, sometimes full of events, but always exceptional and inspiring.</p><p class="italic align-right"><a href="http://krakow.pl/odwiedz_krakow/12117,artykul,miasto_krakow.html">Source – krakow.pl</a></p></section></div><div id="tile_5" class="tile--content"><h2><span>WYD symbols</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><p>Kraków World Youth Day is accompanied by two special symbols donated by John Paul II, which are: WYD Cross and Icon of Our Lady of Salus Populi Romani.

As our guide for the journey we have chosen the Beatitudes. Last year we reflected on the beatitude of the poor in spirit, within the greater context of the Sermon on the Mount. Together we discovered the revolutionary meaning of the Beatitudes and the powerful summons of Jesus to embark courageously upon the exciting quest for happiness. This year we will reflect on the sixth beatitude: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Mt 5:8).</p><h4>1. The desire for happiness</h4><p>The word “blessed”, or “happy”, occurs nine times in this, Jesus’ first great sermon (cf. Mt 5:1-12). It is like a refrain reminding us of the Lord’s call to advance together with him on a road which, for all its many challenges, leads to true happiness.</p><p>Dear young friends, this search for happiness is shared by people of all times and all ages. God has placed in the heart of every man and woman an irrepressible desire for happiness, for fulfillment. Have you not noticed that your hearts are restless, always searching for a treasure which can satisfy their thirst for the infinite?</p><p>The first chapters of the Book of Genesis show us the splendid “beatitude” to which we are called. It consists in perfect communion with God, with others, with nature, and with ourselves. To approach God freely, to see him and to be close to him, was part of his plan for us from the beginning; his divine light was meant to illumine every human relationship with truth and transparency. In the state of original purity, there was no need to put on masks, to engage in ploys or to attempt to conceal ourselves from one another. Everything was clear and pure.</p><p>When Adam and Eve yielded to temptation and broke off this relationship of trusting communion with God, sin entered into human history (cf. Gen 3). The effects were immediately evident, within themselves, in their relationship with each other and with nature. And how dramatic the effects are! Our original purity as defiled. From that time on, we were no longer capable of closeness to God. Men and women began to conceal themselves, to cover their nakedness. Lacking the light which comes from seeing the Lord, they saw everything around them in a distorted fashion, myopically. The inner compass which had guided them in their quest for happiness lost its point of reference, and the attractions of power, wealth, possessions, and a desire for pleasure at all costs, led them to the abyss of sorrow and anguish.</p><p>In the Psalms we hear the heartfelt plea which mankind makes to God: “What can bring us happiness? Let the light of your face shine on us, O Lord” (Ps 4:7). The Father, in his infinite goodness, responded to this plea by sending his Son. In Jesus, God has taken on a human face. Through his Incarnation, life, death and resurrection, Jesus frees us from sin and opens new and hitherto unimaginable horizons.</p><p>Dear young men and women, in Christ you find fulfilled your every desire for goodness and happiness. He alone can satisfy your deepest longings, which are so often clouded by deceptive worldly promises. As Saint John Paul II said: “He is the beauty to which you are so attracted; it is he who provokes you with that thirst for fullness that will not let you settle for compromise; it is he who urges you to shed the masks of a false life; it is he who reads in your hearts your most genuine choices, the choices that others try to stifle. It is Jesus who stirs in you the desire to do something great with your lives” (cf. Discourse at the Prayer Vigil at Tor Vergata, 19 August 2000: Insegnamenti XXIII/2, [2000], 212).</p><h4>2. Blessed are the pure in heart…</h4><p>Let us now try to understand more fully how this blessedness comes about through purity of heart. First of all, we need to appreciate the biblical meaning of the word heart. In Hebrew thought, the heart is the centre of the emotions, thoughts and intentions of the human person. Since the Bible teaches us that God does not look to appearances, but to the heart (cf. 1 Sam 16:7), we can also say that it is from the heart that we see God. This is because the heart is really the human being in his or her totality as a unity of body and soul, in his or her ability to love and to be loved.</p><p>As for the definition of the word pure, however, the Greek word used by the evangelist Matthew is katharos, which basically means clean, pure, undefiled. In the Gospel we see Jesus reject a certain conception of ritual purity bound to exterior practices, one which forbade all contact with things and people (including lepers and strangers) considered impure. To the Pharisees who, like so many Jews of their time, ate nothing without first performing ritual ablutions and observing the many traditions associated with cleansing vessels, Jesus responds categorically: “There is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness” (Mk 7:15, 21-22).</p><p>In what, then, does the happiness born of a pure heart consist? From Jesus’ list of the evils which make someone impure, we see that the question has to do above all with the area of our relationships. Each one of us must learn to discern what can “defile” his or her heart and to form his or her conscience rightly and sensibly, so as to be capable of “discerning the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect” (Rom 12:2). We need to show a healthy concern for creation, for the purity of our air, water and food, but how much more do we need to protect the purity of what is most precious of all: our heart and our relationships. This “human ecology” will help us to breathe the pure air that comes from beauty, from true love, and from holiness.</p><p>Once I asked you the question: “Where is your treasure? In what does your heart find its rest?” (cf. Interview with Young People from Belgium, 31 March 2014). Our hearts can be attached to true or false treasures, they can find genuine rest or they can simply slumber, becoming lazy and lethargic. The greatest good we can have in life is our relationship with God. Are you convinced of this? Do you realize how much you are worth in the eyes of God? Do you know that you are loved and welcomed by him unconditionally, as indeed you are? Once we lose our sense of this, we human beings become an incomprehensible enigma, for it is the knowledge that we are loved unconditionally by God which gives meaning to our lives. Do you remember the conversation that Jesus had with the rich young man (cf. Mk 10:17-22)? The evangelist Mark observes that the Lord looked upon him and loved him (v. 21), and invited him to follow him and thus to find true riches. I hope, dear young friends, that this loving gaze of Christ will accompany each of you throughout life.</p><p>Youth is a time of life when your desire for a love which is genuine, beautiful and expansive begins to blossom in your hearts. How powerful is this ability to love and to be loved! Do not let this precious treasure be debased, destroyed or spoiled. That is what happens when we start to use our neighbours for our own selfish ends, even as objects of pleasure. Hearts are broken and sadness follows upon these negative experiences. I urge you: Do not be afraid of true love, the love that Jesus teaches us and which Saint Paul describes as “patient and kind”. Paul says: “Love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things” (1 Cor 13:4-8).</p><p>In encouraging you to rediscover the beauty of the human vocation to love, I also urge you to rebel against the widespread tendency to reduce love to something banal, reducing it to its sexual aspect alone, deprived of its essential characteristics of beauty, communion, fidelity and responsibility. Dear young friends, “in a culture of relativism and the ephemeral, many preach the importance of ‘enjoying’ the moment. They say that it is not worth making a life-long commitment, making a definitive decision, ‘for ever’, because we do not know what tomorrow will bring. I ask you, instead, to be revolutionaries, I ask you to swim against the tide; yes, I am asking you to rebel against this culture that sees everything as temporary and that ultimately believes you are incapable of responsibility, that believes you are incapable of true love. I have confidence in you and I pray for you. Have the courage to ‘swim against the tide’. And also have the courage to be happy” (Meeting with the Volunteers of the XXVIII Word Youth Day, 28 July 2013).</p><p>You young people are brave adventurers! If you allow yourselves to discover the rich teachings of the Church on love, you will discover that Christianity does not consist of a series of prohibitions which stifle our desire for happiness, but rather a project for life capable of captivating our hearts.</p><h4>3. …for they shall see God</h4><p>In the heart of each man and woman, the Lord’s invitation constantly resounds: “Seek my face!” (Ps 27:8). At the same time, we must always realize that we are poor sinners. For example, we read in the Book of Psalms: “Who can climb the mountain of the Lord? Who shall stand in his holy place? The one who has clean hands and a pure heart” (Ps 24:3-4). But we must never be afraid or discouraged: throughout the Bible and in the history of each one of us we see that it is always God who takes the first step. He purifies us so that we can come into his presence.</p><p>When the prophet Isaiah heard the Lord’s call to speak in his name, he was terrified and said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips” (Is 6:5). And yet the Lord purified him, sending to him an angel who touched his lips, saying: “Your guilt is taken away, and your sin is forgiven” (v. 7). In the New Testament, when on the shores of lake Genessaret Jesus called his first disciples and performed the sign of the miraculous catch of fish, Simon Peter fell at his feet, exclaiming: “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord” (Lk 5:8). Jesus’ reply was immediate: “Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be fishers of men” (v. 10). And when one of the disciples of Jesus asked him: “Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied”, the Master replied: “He who has seen me has seen the Father (Jn 14:8-9).</p><p>The Lord’s invitation to encounter him is made to each of you, in whatever place or situation you find yourself. It suffices to have the desire for “a renewed personal encounter with Jesus Christ, or at least an openness to letting him encounter you; I ask all of you to do this unfailingly each day” (cf. Evangelii Gaudium, 3). We are all sinners, needing to be purified by the Lord. But it is enough to take a small step towards Jesus to realize that he awaits us always with open arms, particularly in the sacrament of Reconciliation, a privileged opportunity to encounter that divine mercy which purifies us and renews our hearts.</p><p>Dear young people, the Lord wants to meet us, to let himself “be seen” by us. “And how?”, you might ask me. Saint Teresa of Avila, born in Spain five hundred years ago, even as a young girl, said to her parents, “I want to see God”. She subsequently discovered the way of prayer as “an intimate friendship with the One who makes us feel loved” (Autobiography, 8,5). So my question to you is this: “Are you praying?” Do you know that you can speak with Jesus, with the Father, with the Holy Spirit, as you speak to a friend? And not just any friend, but the greatest and most trusted of your friends! You will discover what one of his parishioners told the Curé of Ars: “When I pray before the tabernacle, ‘I look at him, and he looks at me’” (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2715).</p><p>Once again I invite you to encounter the Lord by frequently reading sacred Scripture. If you are not already in the habit of doing so, begin with the Gospels. Read a line or two each day. Let God’s word speak to your heart and enlighten your path (cf. Ps 119:105). You will discover that God can be “seen” also in the face of your brothers and sisters, especially those who are most forgotten: the poor, the hungry, those who thirst, strangers, the sick, those imprisoned (cf. Mt 25:31-46). Have you ever had this experience? Dear young people, in order to enter into the logic of the Kingdom of Heaven, we must recognize that we are poor with the poor. A pure heart is necessarily one which has been stripped bare, a heart that knows how to bend down and share its life with those most in need.</p><p>Encountering God in prayer, the reading of the Bible and in the fraternal life will help you better to know the Lord and yourselves. Like the disciples on the way to Emmaus (cf. Lk 24:13-35), the Lord’s voice will make your hearts burn within you. He will open your eyes to recognize his presence and to discover the loving plan he has for your life.</p><p>Some of you feel, or will soon feel, the Lord’s call to married life, to forming a family. Many people today think that this vocation is “outdated”, but that is not true! For this very reason, the ecclesial community has been engaged in a special period of reflection on the vocation and the mission of the family in the Church and the contemporary world. I also ask you to consider whether you are being called to the consecrated life or the priesthood. How beautiful it is to see young people who embrace the call to dedicate themselves fully to Christ and to the service of his Church! Challenge yourselves, and with a pure heart do not be afraid of what God is asking of you! From your “yes” to the Lord’s call, you will become new seeds of hope in the Church and in society. Never forget: God’s will is our happiness!</p><h4>4. On the way to Krakow</h4><p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Mt 5:8). Dear young men and women, as you see, this beatitude speaks directly to your lives and is a guarantee of your happiness. So once more I urge you: Have the courage to be happy!</p><p>This year’s World Youth Day begins the final stage of preparations for the great gathering of young people from around the world in Krakow in 2016. Thirty years ago Saint John Paul II instituted World Youth Days in the Church. This pilgrimage of young people from every continent under the guidance of the Successor of Peter has truly been a providential and prophetic initiative. Together let us thank the Lord for the precious fruits which these World Youth Days have produced in the lives of countless young people in every part of the globe! How many amazing discoveries have been made, especially the discovery that Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life! How many people have realized that the Church is a big and welcoming family! How many conversions, how many vocations have these gatherings produced! May the saintly Pope, the Patron of World Youth Day, intercede on behalf of our pilgrimage toward his beloved Krakow. And may the maternal gaze of the Blessed Virgin Mary, full of grace, all-beautiful and all-pure, accompany us at every step along the way.</p><p class="italic">From the Vatican, 31 January 2015 <br>Memorial of Saint John Bosco</p><p class="strong">Francis</p><p class="italic align-right"><a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/youth/documents/papa-francesco_20150131_messaggio-giovani_2015.html">Source – vatican.va</a></p></section></div><div id="tile_7" class="tile--content"><h2><span>P2P Program</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><figure style="width:100%;padding-top:42.37%;position:relative"><img src="/img/wyd_info_p2p_baner.png" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0" data-no-retina="true"></figure><p>Pope Francis is the one who invites us to be close to people who are in bad way. “To you young people I especially entrust the task of restoring solidarity to the heart of human culture. Faced with old and new forms of poverty – unemployment, migration and addictions of various kinds – we have the duty to be alert and thoughtful, avoiding the temptation to remain indifferent. We have to remember all those who feel unloved, who have no hope for the future and who have given up on life out of discouragement, disappointment or fear. We have to learn to be on the side of the poor, and not just indulge in rhetoric about the poor! Let us go out to meet them, look into their eyes and listen to them. The poor provide us with a concrete opportunity to encounter Christ himself, and to touch his suffering flesh.”</p><p class="strong">The invitation to everyday common prayer with the Chaplet of Divine Mercy is a specific response to the task that the Holy Father gave us. Every Sunday of Lent, we encourage you to pray in the communities, families, circles of friends, in your environment, with the intentions proclaimed in the message of Francis Pope for World Youth Day 2014. Join us! Let us bring together the hope of God's love to the world.</p><h3>What is the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy?</h3><p>This is a unique prayer which was dictated by Jesus Himself – He is the author. The prayer reminds us that Jesus gave His life for us out of love. It serves as a reminder how much we need God and His mercy. We need Him, the whole world needs Him.</p><h3>What is most important in the Chaplet?</h3><p>Trust – it’s crucial to agree with what God wants for you and for the whole world, and to believe that it is the best. To ask with trust means to know that God will answer your call in the best moment and in the best way, and not necessarily as you have planned it. He is God. Do you trust in Him?</p><figure style="width:100%;padding-top:141.44%;position:relative"><img src="/img/wyd_info_p2p_chaplet.png" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0" data-no-retina="true"></figure><p class="italic align-right"><a href="http://www.krakow2016.com/en/whats-the-matter">Source – krakow2016.com</a></p></section></div><div id="tile_8" class="tile--content"><h2><span>Hymn of WYD</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><figure style="width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZRsoPmeZXk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen  style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0"></iframe><figcaption>Official hymn of World Youth Days 2016</figcaption></figure><figure style="width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5BrV6IvTBEc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0"></iframe><figcaption>Movie of making of hymn of WYD Kraków 2016</figcaption></figure><div class="content--wrapper"><div class="content--lyrics"><h3>Polish lyrics</h3><p>Wznoszę swe oczy ku górom<br>skąd przyjdzie mi pomoc,<br>pomoc od Pana, wszak Bogiem On<br>Miłosiernym jest!</p><p>Kiedy zbłądzimy Sam szuka nas,<br>by w swe ramiona wziąć,<br>rany uleczyć Krwią Swoich Ran,<br>nowe życie tchnąć!<br> </p><p class="strong">Błogosławieni miłosierni,<br>Albowiem oni miłosierdzia dostąpią!</p><p>Gdyby nam Pan nie odpuścił win,<br>Któż ostać by się mógł?<br>Lecz On przebacza, przeto i my<br>Czyńmy jak nasz Bóg!</p><p>Pan Syna Krwią zmazał wszelki dług,<br>Syn z grobu żywy wstał,<br>„Panem jest Jezus!” – mówi w nas Duch,<br>niech to widzi świat!<br> </p><p>[BRIDGE]</p><p>Więc odrzuć lęk i wiernym bądź,<br>swe troski w Panu złóż,<br>i ufaj, bo zmartwychwstał i wciąż<br>żyje Pan, Twój Bóg!</p></div><div class="content--lyrics"><h3>English lyrics</h3><p>I raise my eyes to the mountains,<br>from where help will come<br>from the Lord, because He<br>is a merciful God!</p><p>When we are lost, He looks for us,<br>so as to take us in His arms,<br>healing our wounds with the blood of His wounds,<br>breathing new life into us.</p><p class="strong">Blessed are the merciful<br>For they shall receive mercy!<br> </p><p>If the Lord did not forgive us our sins<br>who could survive alone?<br>But He forgives, so too<br>should we do as our God!</p><p>By His own Son’s blood God erased every debt<br>His Son rose alive from the tomb;<br>“Jesus is Lord” – the Spirit tells us from within.<br>Let the world see this!</p><p>[BRIDGE]</p><p>So throw away your fear and have faith,<br>confide your problems in the Lord<br>and trust in Him, for He is risen<br>and is alive, your God!</p><p class="italic">By Henryk Michael Kurylewski – <a href="http://catholicleader.com.au/youth/english-translation-of-wyd-krakow-2016-hymn">Source</a></p></div></div><h3>Download</h3><ul><li> <a href="http://www.krakow2016.com/upload/files/Błogosławieni%20Miłosierni_prymka.pdf">Melodic line (PDF)</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.krakow2016.com/audio/hymn.mp3">Audio file (MP3)</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.krakow2016.com/audio/hymn.wav">Audio file (WAV)</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.krakow2016.com/upload/files/BŁOGOSŁAWIENI%20MIŁOSIERNI_TEKST.pdf">Hymn lyrics in Polish (PDF)</a></li></ul><h3>Story behind composing of the hymn</h3><p>After winning the competition for writing the World Youth Day 2016 hymn, Jakub Blycharz sat down with us for an interview. He mentioned that before he began composing the lyrics, he looked to the Bible for some inspiring words. There he then found promise in the 31st chapter from the book of Deuteronomy; the part entitled “The hymn as a witness”: “Write out this song then for yourselves. Teach it to the Israelites and have them recite it, so that this song may be a witness for me against the Israelites”.</p><p>These words commenced work on the hymn and also became the character for the lyrics throughout the song; the text is rooted in the words of the Holy Scriptures and written into poetic paraphrases. The hymn starts with an excerpt from Psalm 121 (120), which pours into our hearts peace and confidence that the merciful Lord is watching over us and will fulfil the promise that he will accompany humankind “now and forever”. Right in the first verse, in the middle of the quotation from the Old Testament, God is described as merciful.</p><p>In the second verse we find references to the parable of the lost sheep from St. Luke’s Gospel (Lk 15: 1–7), which raises hope to God’s untiring efforts to bring just one man back to the fullness of life. In the parable Jesus assures of the great joy that is brought about in heaven from the conversion of each and every sinner. Through His death on the cross, Jesus gave us access to a new life – he brought mankind to the eternal plan of salvation thanks to his Holy Blood poured out for us.</p><p>The chorus consists of the words from the fifth Beatitude, first heard during the Sermon on the Mount from St Matthew’s Gospel (Mt 5:3-10): “Blessed are the merciful for they shall be shown mercy”. This is also the message of the World Youth Days which will take place in Krakow – the city of the message of mercy that was given to St. Faustyna Kowalska.</p><p>The third verse is a paraphrase of the excerpt from Psalm 130 “De Profundis”: “If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, / Lord, who could stand? / But there is forgiveness with you, / that you may be feared”. God’s attitude towards us is our inspiration to embrace an attitude of mercy in our relationships with others.</p><p>The next verse conveys a meaning of some important points of Kerygma (a set of the basic truths of the Gospel), which refer to our ultimate deliverance in the crucified, buried and resurrected Christ; as well as accepting him through faith as one’s Lord and Saviour.</p><p class="italic align-right"><a href="http://sdmrzeszow.pl/bez-kategorii-en/blessed-are-the-merciful-the-official-hymn-of-xxxi-wyd-krakow-2016/">Source – sdmrzeszow.pl</a></p></section></div><div id="tile_9" class="tile--content"><h2><span>Prayer for WYD</span></h2><section class="content--text content--text-w-center"><p>“‘God, merciful father,<br />
in your son, Jesus Christ, you have revealed your love<br />
and poured it out upon us in the Holy Spirit, the comforter,<br />
we entrust to you today the destiny of the world and of every man and woman.’<br />
We entrust to you in a special way<br />
young people of every language, people and nation:<br />
guide and protect them as they walk the complex paths of the world today<br />
and give them the grace to reap abundant fruits<br />
from their experience of the Krakow World Youth Day.<br /></p>
<p>Heavenly Father,<br />
grant that we may bear witness to your mercy.<br />
Teach us how to convey the faith to those in doubt,<br />
hope to those who are discouraged,<br />
love to those who feel indifferent,<br />
forgiveness to those who have done wrong<br />
and joy to those who are unhappy.<br />
Allow the spark of merciful love that you have en-kindled within us<br />
become a fire that can transform hearts<br />
and renew the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Mary, Mother of Mercy, pray for us.<br />
St. John Paul II, pray for us.”</p>

Its goal is to raise funds for the Eastern youth to allow them to participate in the WYD in Poland in 2016.</p><h3>Where did the idea come from?</h3><p>TfB resulted from two experiences. The first was the extraordinary hospitality that we came across as WYD pilgrims during our stay in Brazil. We want to return the favor by opening our hearts and helping those for whom participation in WYD is too expensive.</p><p>The second experience was testimonies of faith during the WYD in Częstochowa. Many young people from the East of Europe participated in this meeting. In preparation for the next WYD in Poland, we particularly want to remember our peers from the East.  For many of them, WYD may be the first experience of the international Church community. If they do not attend WYD in Poland, the next WYD will be even more distant and expensive for them.</p><h3>Who do we help?</h3><p>First of all, we want to help the youth from the East. Our support is intended for groups of pilgrims from 13 East European and Transcaucasia countries, who will officially register for the WYD 2016. Countries taken into account for our project are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.</p><p>We want to give the opportunity to people who would like to attend WYD 2016 by offering help, even if only by this one-time gesture. We invite you to join TfB’s action - families, communities, artists and companies. Everyone together!</p><h3>What do we offer?</h3><p>We want to give financial support to the youth from the East by funding their pilgrim’s package, which is a set of services that each participant at WYD is obligated to buy in order to participate in the event safely and fully.</p><p>For those preparing for WYD, we offer initiatives that will help them understand the intention and history of WYD, as well as learn how to use one’s talents creatively. Among others, we offer: creating and buying valuable donations, participation in cultural and sports events, establishing contacts with the youth from the East and many, many others. </p><p>We hope that everyone who would like to join in the preparation of WYD 2016 through charitable works, such as supporting the young people from the East, personally reads the invitation of Jesus expressed in the topic of The World Youth Day: “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy” (Mt 5,7).</p><h3>How to support the idea?</h3><p>To support TfB, payments may be made on a bank account:<address>Krajowe Biuro Organizacyjne ŚDM
